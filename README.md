# Linux-Semaphores---Doctor-Appointment-Project
 This project simulates the activity of a doctor's office that has a predefined number of patients scheduled for that day. The order in which patients arrive and the time at which they begin their examination is solved using different threads for each patient and the existing semaphores in Linux.
